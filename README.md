College Process Improvement Initiative: GBC International Admissions

International students upload their documents and submit their applications through the GBC ‘Online Application for International Students’ portal. After application submission, the students have no clarity on the status of their applications until a decision is made and must communicate with the International admissions team via mail for all their queries. 

The goal is to improve the admission process for international students so that prospective students have transparency and an enhanced experience. This will also benefit the international admissions team by reducing the burden on admissions communication.
